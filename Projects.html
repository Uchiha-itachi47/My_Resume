    <p>THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO
        IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM<br /> THAT CAN ANALYSE EACH
        DEVICE IN A RESIDENTIAL OR <br />COMMERCIAL
        BUILDING WHILE PROVIDING REAL-TIME<br />
        FEEDBACK AND BILL PRODUCTION. THE ENTIRE
        PROCESS IS <br />DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF
        TIME THAT EACH DEVICE IS<br /> IN USE, AS WELL AS
        THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF POWER USED,<br /> WHICH IS
        CALCULATED AND SHOWN ON A WEB
        DASHBOARD<br /> OR A MOBILE APPLICATION</p> <hr /><br />
    <h2>HOME SECURITY SYSTEM USING IOT:</h2>

    <p>THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DESIGN
        AND IMPLEMENT <br />A HOME SECURITY SYSTEM
        USING INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT)<br /> TECHNOLOGY.
        THE SYSTEM IS IMPLEMENTED USING A
        RASPBERRY PI<br /> AS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING
        UNIT AND IOT DEVICES, SUCH AS<br /> SMART SENSORS
        AND CAMERAS, A CLOUD-BASED ANALYTICS
        PLATFORM<br /> IS CONNECTED WITH THE SYSTEM TO
        OFFER REAL-TIME MONITORING<br /> AND ALERT
        MESSAGES. THE SYSTEM CAN QUICKLY AND
        ACCURATELY<br /> IDENTIFY AND REPORT SECURITY
        EVENTS LIKE FIRES AND INFILTRATION<br /> ATTEMPTS.
        IT IS SIMPLER TO MONITOR AND MANAGE THE
        PROPERTY'S<br /> SECURITY THANKS TO THE
        INTEGRATION WITH A CLOUD-BASED ANALYTICS<br />
        PLATFORM, WHICH ALLOWS CONVENIENT AND
        SECURE ACCESS TO SYSTEM<br /> DATA AND ALARMS</p> <hr /> <br>
